# Sens Randomizer

This script was a simple quick script I wrote to generate random sensitivities for Valorant then write to a text file for OBS to read and display on stream.


# Usage
Linux: set randomSens.py to be an executable then run randomSens.py

Windows: set randomSens.py to open with python then double click to run

New sensitivity is saved in sens.txt
